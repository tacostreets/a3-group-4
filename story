Kathy Ramsbottom was thinking about David Ball again. David was a lovable monster with sticky thighs and fluffy fingernails.
Kathy walked over to the window and reflected on her chilly surroundings. She had always loved grey Moscow with its jolly, jealous jungle. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel cross.
Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a lovable figure of David Ball.
